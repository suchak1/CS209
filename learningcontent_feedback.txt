There appears to be a mismatch between the stated ages
(3rd-6th grade) and the LT (several items marked HS?)
Teaching from 3rd grade all the way through high school
would require a much more detailed LT. Moving forward, you should
scale back your list of subjects so that you can provide a more
detailed LT within the content area you're teaching. Is the red
arithmetic? And the intermediate when algebra (variables) comes in?
