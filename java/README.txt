LabFourGame:

In our game, you must navigate Mario to the sun. If he hits an asteroid, you lose 10 points, and if your score goes
below 0 you lose. All controls from LabOneGame work here (rotating, moving with arrow keys, scaling, etc.). There is
music playing continuously during the game. There is a soundeffect for when mario hits an asteroid, and another sound
effect if you lose the game.


LabFiveGame:

The rules and controls of our game are the same as in lab four. Our gravity pulls the rocket ship towards the sun (because why not). When mario hits an asteroid, he will bounce away from it. The asteroids do not move because they are way heavier than mario.
