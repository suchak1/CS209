Excellent.

Cultural-relevant design			5/5
Great.

MVP						9/10

Structure it so that you have
Level 1: Simple level (attic is fine for this)
Level N: intermediate (this needs to be barely easier than next one)
Level N+1: intermediate, barely harder than N (Ground floor is fine)

I think that doing full floors as a single "level" might be too hard. How about
if you just have two rooms for each "level" and show me two levels that are 
barely harder than each other, at the level of difficulty of the ground floor.
