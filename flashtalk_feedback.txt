Wording - short phrases				5/5

Explained game					0/5
Talked a lot about what *type* of game you wanted to 
have, but not a lot about the *actual* game you have.
Screenshots of the actual puzzles would have helped.
The one example didn't really seem to be about fractions,
more about matching shapes. So I didn't understand
what the mini-games really look like.

Included interesting aspects of game		5/5

Used vocab form course				3/5
Could have used more vocab from course. Said 
"players who like to get rewards" rather than the 
vocabulary word for the types of players.
